        Hi! I’m a passionate <span className="font-semibold text-indigo-600">
        MERN Stack Developer</span> who loves turning ideas into real, scalable and high-performance
        digital products. I specialize in building modern, responsive, and intuitive web applications
        with clean code and solid architecture.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-7 mb-4">
        My expertise lies in crafting end-to-end solutions — from creating powerful backends with
        Node.js & Express, to building beautiful and dynamic user interfaces with React and Tailwind CSS.
        I enjoy solving complex problems, optimizing performance, and writing maintainable code that is
        easy to scale.

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-7 mb-4">
        I stay constantly updated with the latest technologies, best practices, and modern
        development trends. Whether it's designing APIs, integrating third-party services, managing
        databases with MongoDB, or deploying full-stack applications — I handle every part of the
        development lifecycle with precision.

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-7">
        My goal is simple: <span className="font-semibold text-indigo-600">
